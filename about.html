    <p>INFO...</p>
    <p>Alyssa Joines // GoddessLyss<br>
    <br>I am a New York based artist working in the field of creative technology with a particular interest in 3D/VFX and generative art. Inspired by surrealism, futurism, mathematics, and biology I enjoy exploring the emergent properties of algorithmically generated visuals and the overlap between the real and the imagined.<br>
    <br>I am currently in my fourth year of study at The New School. As a dual degree student, Iâ€™m pursuing a BFA in Design and Technology from Parsons School of Design and a BA in Interdisciplinary Science from Eugene Lang College.<br>
    <br>I am looking to expand my work into fields such as album cover art, poster design, and responsive visuals. If you have a project in mind or would like to collaborate please contact me via email or social media.</p>
