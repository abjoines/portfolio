    <p>GoddessLyss // Alyssa Joines<br>
    <br>I am a <span>New York City</span> based artist working in the field of creative technology with a particular interest in <span>3D/VFX</span> and <span>generative art</span>. Inspired by surrealism, futurism, mathematics, and biology I enjoy exploring the emergent properties of algorithmically generated visuals and the overlap between the real and the imagined.<br>
    <br>I am currently in my fourth year of study at The New School. As a dual degree student, Iâ€™m pursuing a BFA in <span>Design and Technology</span> from <span>Parsons School of Design</span> and a BA in <span>Interdisciplinary Science</span> from <span>Eugene Lang College</span>.<br>
    <br>I am looking to expand my work into fields such as <span>album cover art, poster design, and responsive visuals</span>. If you have a project in mind or would like to collaborate please contact me via email or social media.</p>
