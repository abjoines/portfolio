        <h1>Deepfakes</h1>
        <h3><span>What are deepfakes?</span> Deepfakes are videos where one persons face has been replaced by another. 
        These videos can really range in quality but the most convincing ones are incredible examples of what current <span>artificial intelligence</span> is capable of.
        You can find a variety of examples on youtube but watch out for NSFW content.</h3>
        <h3>System Mapping</h3>
        <p> The beginning portion of this project was research. First I dug deep into the technologies that have made deepfakes possible and their origins. 
            I then explored the impact that deepfakes have had and may have on society and culture in the future. To display this information clearly I created a map of the system.
            The dark blue nodes are key people and the lighter blue nodes are technologies, groups, companies etc. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The <span>top right</span> portion is a simplified history of <span>the technology</span> used to produce deepfakes. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The <span>upper left</span> portion is connected to that as it shows the <span>open source technologies</span> used by people who aren't as well versed in AI.
            <br>
            <br>
            The <span>bottom left</span> portion is the <span>short history</span> of the reddit user Deepfakes who played a large role in the popularization of deepfakes and the impact that was made.
            <br>
            <br>
            The <span>bottom right</span> showcases the most recent <span>reaction</span> to the existence and use of deepfakes.

        <h3>Predictive Product: Iris</h3>
        <p>In response to my research I then created a <span>predictive product</span> of the future that I believe will be available in the next 5-7 years due to the affordances of deepfake technology.
            After some brainstorming I came up with the idea for a service where you can send and recieve video messages from loved ones who have passed away.
            The name of this service is <span><em>iris</em></span>. 
        </p>
        <img class="five" src="../assets/irisAd.png">
        <p>Iris is the name of a goddess who, according to greek mythology, is the messenger to the gods and therefore able to communicate between worlds.
            This product would allow parents who are widowed to send their kids video messages for special occasions, allow them to meet deceased grandparents, or whatever the situation may be.
            There would be preset options for messages such as birthdays, weddings, graduations, and more with the option to personalize for an extra fee.
            To have your video message created and sent the steps are as follows:
        </p>
        <ol class="fakes">
            <li>upload a set of images and videos of the "sender"</li>
            <li>input date and time of video reciept</li>
            <li>submit preferred method of delivery (email, SMS, other)</li>
            <li>select from message types: birthday, graduation, and more</li>
            <li>add extra features: name personalization, write your own script, multi-person</li>
        </ol>
