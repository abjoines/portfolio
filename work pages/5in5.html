    <h1>Exploring Dimensions</h1>
    <h3>For this project I set <span>two constraints for my process</span>. The first constraint was that I must <span>explore a different dimension in each "sketch"</span>. This could be taken literally or be done in a representational manner. The second constraint was that my <span>color palette be defined by a random page in a magazine</span>. Through the use of these I created the following projects.</h3>
    
    <p>5D + Red/White</p>
    <p>This is an <span>orthographic projection of a 5-cube</span>. A 5-cube, as its name would suggest, is a 5 dimensional hypercube. This geometry has 32 vertices, 80 edges, 80 square faces, 40 cubic cells, and 10 tesseract 4-faces. In order to visualize these types of geometries we typically use orthographic projections. To build mine I used foam board, some L shaped nails I had, white string, and red marker for the points (which are now almost completely hidden under the string). I was able to find patterns in the edges which allowed me to weave the strings instead of connecting each vertex individually.</p>

    <p>3D + Pink/Green</p>
    <p>Looking through the easily malleable materials in my apartment I landed on pipe cleaners. Using the ones I had in the appropriate colors I created what is essentially a <span>figure 8</span> shape. To do this I wrapped pipe cleaners around a pencil forming tight spirals and then ran a straight pipe cleaner through those. I made sure that all spirals were adjacent to a one of a different color.</p>

    <p>2D + Red/Yellow</p>
    <p>I was inspired by the item in which I found my color palette, a magazine, and created a <span>collage</span>. I cut out all of the appealing yellow and red shapes and subsequently glued these onto a piece of bristol paper, cutting out the remaining white space.</p>

    <p>1D + Blue/Black/Silver</p>
    <p>I wanted to create something out of 1 dimensional things, points. I went for a <span>pointillism</span> style but varying the size of the points to create texture.</p>
